Hi everyone, this will be a page decicated to Labs for Survival Models 2025. 

As the majority of the code is provided for you in this class, and you will not be asked to write any code, I will create some interactive notebooks to aid with your learning.

One method to learn how to code is by imitation, ie typing out the syntax alongside reading the solutions.

Each class will have empty sections of code in Quarto via RStudio for you to add code to alongside the solution, which will be provided in a html. You can view html files in a browser. 

Happy Learning and Happy Coding
